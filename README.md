# Victor Chanet's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I've designed this site to showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience. It's built with modern web technologies to be fast, responsive, and easily customizable.

I also designed this project to serve as a template for fellow engineers, developers, and game developers. That's why I've made it incredibly easy to edit and customize. Feel free to fork it and make it your own!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Content**: All portfolio data, from personal information to project details, is managed in simple TypeScript files, making it easy to update.
- **Multi-language Support**: The portfolio is designed to be multilingual (English, French, Spanish).
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Key Sections**: Includes a Hero section, About Me, Work Experience, Projects, and Contact information.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Customize

This portfolio is designed to be easily customized by editing the files in the `src/data/` directory. No need to dig into the React components to change the content.

- **`src/data/user.ts`**: Edit this file to change your personal information, such as your name, title, email, social media links, and professional summary.

- **`src/data/hero.ts`**: This file controls the content of the main hero section on the homepage.

- **`src/data/about.ts`**: Update this file to modify the content in the "About Me" section, including your bio and skills.

- **`src/data/projects.ts`**: Add, remove, or modify your projects here. Each project object contains its title, description, tags, and links.
